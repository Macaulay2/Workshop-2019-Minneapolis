            A cell complex in this context is the combinatorial data of a
            CW-complex, i.e. a collection of cells in various dimensions along
            with their boundary expressed as a sequence of cells along with an
            orientation such that the boundary is a cycle.

            of cells and their orientation, or a list of cells.

            infer it based on the labels on the boundary

    Description
        Text
            This function creates a new cell, to be added to a cell complex,
            if given a list of cells without any orientation information, it
            attempts to infer the orientation.
        Text
            If given an empty list for the boundary, the function creates a
            0-cell (a vertex).
        Text
            If not given a label, and the labels on the boundary are monomials
            or monomial ideals, from the same ring, then the label is the lcm
            of the labels of the boundary
        Example
            R = QQ[x,y]
            a = newCell({},x);
            b = newCell({},y);
            c1 = newCell {(a,1),(a,-1)};

            c3 = newCell {a,b};
            C = cellComplex(R,{c1,c2,c3});
    Caveat
        This function does not check that there is a valid map from the boundary
        of a n-cell to the given boundary. It only checks that the boundary
        forms a cycle in homology.

            This function will only create simplices, and it will verify that
            the new cell is a simplex, as such does not have the caveat of
            @TO newCell@. Otherwise it has the same behavior. This is
            particularly useful in constructing \Delta-complexes.

    	returns the $r$-skeleton of a cell complex 
    Usage 
    	skeleton(ZZ,CellComplex)
    Inputs 
    	r : ZZ 
    	C : CellComplex
	    a cell complex 
    Outputs 
    	: CellComplex 
	    the $r$-skeleton of the cell complex $C$
    Description 
    	Text 
	    The $r$-skeleton of a cell complex is the union of its cells whose dimension is at most $r$. 
	Example 
	    R = QQ[x];
	    P = hypercube 3;
	    C = cellComplex(R,P);
	    dim C
	    cells C

	    a cell complex 
    Outputs

    Description 
    	Text 
	    This command checks if the modules associated to the labels in the cell complex are all free, which is necessary to create the cellular resolution. 
	Example 
	    R = QQ[x,y,z];
	    v1 = newCell({},ideal(x,y));
	    C1 = cellComplex(R,{v1});

    Description 
    	Text 
	    Given a cell complex C and a hashtable, whose key-value pairs are a cell from C and a new label for that cell, this command relabels C accordingly. 
	    Labels for cells not provided in the hashtable are inferred to be the lcm of the labels of their boundary cells, unless the option InferLabels is turned off.
