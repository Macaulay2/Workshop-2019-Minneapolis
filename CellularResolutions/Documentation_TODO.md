# Minor Issues #
- Document better what labels need or don't need to be for various functions to work
- Cell
  - No example
- CellComplex
  - No Example
- boundary
  - Put some text between the two examples or combined them
- boundaryCell
  - Put some text between the two examples or combined them
- cellComplex
  - either split the cellComplex key from cellComplex(Ring,List) or combined all of them?
- cells
  - needs text between the examples
- boundary(ZZ,CellComplex)
  - better example?
- chainComplex(CellComplex)
  - Make sure all optional parameters are covered
- HH CellComplex
  - needs more detail, discuss the labels
- HH^ZZ CellComplex
  - needs a description
- HH_ZZ CellComplex
  - needs more detail, discuss the labels
  - maybe merge with HH node
- LabelFunction
  - missing documentation

# Short but probably not an issue

- cellComplex(Ring,PolyhedralComplex)
- cellComplex(Ring,Polyhedron)
- cellComplex(SimplicialComplex)
- cell(ZZ,CellComplex)
- ring(CellComplex)
- RingMap ** CellComplex
- dim(Cell)
- dim(CellComplex)
- facePoset(CellComplex)
