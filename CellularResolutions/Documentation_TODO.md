# Minor Issues #
- Document better what labels need or don't need to be for various functions to work
- Cell
  - No example
- CellComplex
  - No Example
- boundary
  - Put some text between the two examples or combined them
- boundaryCell
  - Put some text between the two examples or combined them
- cellComplex
  - either split the cellComplex key from cellComplex(Ring,List) or combined all of them?
- cells
  - needs text between the examples
- chainComplex(CellComplex)
  - Make sure all optional parameters are covered
  - discuss how the labels work
- LabelFunction
  - missing documentation
- net(Cell)
  - missing documentation?
- net(CellComplex)
  - missing documentation?
