TO DO in CellularResolutions package: 

General: 
-- Documentation documentation documentation 
-- Clean up the SimplicialComplexes package

Specific: (In approximate order of importance)
1) Add homology function that can be applied directly to the cell complex (Done)
2) Add tools for cohomology (Partial)
3) Add a database of common complexes
   a) Sphere
   b) RP^n
   c) Torus
4) Get a cell complex from a polytope/simplicial complex (Done, needs more tests)
5) Be able to check at the cell complex level minimality/resolutionness (Minimality: done)
6) Use options in homology/chainComplex to allow the user to choose reduced homology.
7) New attach function that takes for input a cell complex and a boundary (and a label?), and returns a new cell complex with a cell attached there
8) Make labelRing optional (just make it QQ (or ZZ?) by default) 
9) Make a relabel function (something that maps old values to new values)
10) Create a way of giving nice output for cells/cell complexes (net) (Done)
11) Cache results (chainComplex cached)
12) Figure out how carefully we can check if something is a CW complex
13) Add a n-skeleton function (Done)
14) Function for cell poset (Ola)
15) Add polyhedral complex -> cell complex code
16) Wedge/Connect Sum/cone/etc of cell complexes

Issues:
1) Make sure boundary maps are indexed correctly
