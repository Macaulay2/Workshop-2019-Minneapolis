Our group worked to implement the construction of and methods relating to toric maps.

1) Old code was debugged and documented.

2) Method "isProper" was rewritten. Significant speedup.

3) Pullbacks of Cartier divisors was implemented and documented.

4) Currently considering pullbacks of coherent sheaves and a "isSurjective" method.
